Follow WCAG 2.1 Guidelines**\n- Ensure content is **perceivable** (visible to all users)\n- Make interfaces **operable** (keyboard accessible)\n- Keep content **understandable** (clear language)\n- Build **robust** systems (compatible with assistive tech)\n\n**2. Visual Design Principles**\n- Use color contrast ratios of 4.5:1+ for text\n- Provide text alternatives for images\n- Design for multiple screen readers\n- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information\n\n**3. Interaction Patterns**\n- Support full keyboard navigation\n- Provide visible focus indicators\n- Use semantic HTML elements\n- Implement ARIA labels where needed\n\n**4. Testing & Validation**\n- Test with actual assistive technologies\n- Conduct user testing with diverse abilities\n- Use automated accessibility checkers\n- Regular accessibility audits\n\nSources: WCAG 2.1 (W3C), academic research on universal design, industry best practices from research papers.",
